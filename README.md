## Project

This project is about setting up a **Virtual Machine** using either **Debian** or **CentOS** but without a graphic interface. I guess this is valuable to learn the basics about installing the OS setting up and maintaining a server but also the hardware and virtual machines, since all of these can be pretty useful knowledge for a developer regardless of their field of work.

## Mandatory Part

There are a few requirements but I won't get into the details of each thing.

- specific naming for things like user, hostname, groups, etc.
- how to setup the Logic Volume Management (LVM)
- SSH, sudo, firewall, etc.
- strong password policy
- a [monitoring script](monitoring_script.md) with some basic system informations

## Bonus Part

The bonus needs a different **LVM** setup, a bit more complex than the mandatory part since it has to be done manually. In the bonus we are setting up a WordPress Server and an extra service like a **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**.

## Setup

If you are going to do the Bonus or even if you don't, setup the LVM according to the bonus, you get some extra points.
